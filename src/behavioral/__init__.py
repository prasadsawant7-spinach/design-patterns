"""
Behavioral Design Patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.\n
**1. Observer**\n
The Observer design pattern establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This promotes loose coupling between the observed subject and its observers, facilitating flexible and scalable system designs.\n
**2. Strategy**\n
The Strategy design pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it, promoting flexibility and enabling runtime selection of algorithms.\n
**3. State**\n
The State design pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. By encapsulating state-specific behavior into separate classes, it promotes cleaner code, simplifies maintenance, and facilitates the addition of new states without modifying existing code.
