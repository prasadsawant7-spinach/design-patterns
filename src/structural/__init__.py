"""
Structural Design Patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.\n
**1. Adapter**\n
The Adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, making them work together. This pattern involves a single class, known as the adapter, which is responsible for joining functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.\n
**2. Facade**\n
The Facade design pattern acts as a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying interactions and promoting ease of use. It shields clients from the complexities of the subsystem, enhancing code readability and maintainability.\n
**3. Decorator**\n
The Decorator design pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically and without affecting other objects of the same class. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
